# Get your number

This is a program I wrote for 118118 when I worked there as a phonejockey.  About two weeks after I handed it in, the big boss released an entire computerised training program, that wasn't that dissimilar to the program I had written.  Its in Visual basic 6.0, and runs from setup.exe.

From the original Readme.txt

Get your number is a program to teach locality codes and x-factors to help lower CPT so you can spend more time on achieving 100% quality on customer service.
It has been tested on Windows 98 se and on Windows Xp.

all my code is released using an MIT license.
